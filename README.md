# Next Sentence Prediction using Generative AI

This is a project built for the IBM GenAI course. It uses a model called GPT-2 to guess what the next sentence might be, based on whatever text you give it. The whole thing runs on Google Colab and uses tools from Hugging Face.



## What This Project Does

- You type a sentence (for example: I went to the park to)
- The AI reads it and tries to guess what comes next
- It shows the complete sentence as output


## Tools Used

| Tool           | What it's used for                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| transformers   | To load and use the GPT-2 model            |
| torch          | For running the model in the background    |
| Google Colab   | So you can run everything in the cloud     |



## Files Included

- ibm_project.ipynb – The main notebook where all the code is written
- README.md – This file, explaining the project


## Example
